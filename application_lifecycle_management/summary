ROLLING UPDATES AND ROLLBACK

There are 2 strategies for deploying:
	- Recreate - all pods deleted and then new pods created.
	- Rolling update - pods deleted one by one, only defined percentage of pods can be down.
To perform rollback:
	kubectl rollout undo deployment/service_name

CONFIGURING APPLICATION

Comprises of 3 parts:
	- Configuring commands and arguments
	- Configuring environmental variables
	- Configuring secrets

COMMANDS

Docker container runs a certain command.
Once the command is finished, container is deleted.
Command can be specified by ENTRYPOINT instruction in Dockerfile.
Arguments of a command specified in CMD section of a Dockerfile.
CMD section can be overwritten by adding a command right after the name of a container:
	docker run ubuntu 20
ENTRYPOINT can be ovewritten by specifying --entypoint in "docker run":
	docker run ubuntu --entrypoint sleep 20

COMMANDS AND ARGUMENTS

In K8s "command" field corresponds to "entrypoint"
"args" field corresponds to CMD
Arguments, specified in K8S, owerwrite arguments of a Dockerfile.

ENVIRONMENTAL VARIABLES

Can be specified in "env" field. it is an array.
There a 3 wais of defining environmental variables:
	- directly in definition file
	- from ConfigMap
	- from Secret

MULTI CONTAINER POD

Container inside these pods share the same network and the same storage.
There are 3 design patterns of multi-container pods:
	- Sidecar
	- Adapter
	- Ambassador
INIT CONTAINER
Created before the main container starts, does some job and gets deleted.
Then main container gets up
