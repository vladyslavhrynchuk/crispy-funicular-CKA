There are lots of monitoring solutions:
 - Prometheus
 - Metrics server
 - Dynatrace
 - Datadog
 - Elastic Stack

HEAPSTER was the initial solution for monitoring.
Now deprecated and replaced by METRICS SERVER.
You can have one metrics server per cluster.
It retrieves data from each node and store it IN MEMORY.

Kubelet contains cAdvisor, which is responsible for retrieving performance metrics from pods.

To run METRICS SERVER, just copy repo from github and aply all yaml files inside directory.
Commands:
	kubectl top node 
	kubectl top pod

To view logs:
	kubectl logs -f(for live) <pod name>
	kubectl logs -f <pod name> <container name> (for multicontainer pods)
