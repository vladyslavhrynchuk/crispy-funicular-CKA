	- Storage Drivers (handles layered architecture)
	- Volume Drivers (handles volumes)
When Docker installed, it create folder structure:
	/var/lib/docker/{aufs, containers, image, volumes}
There are 2 types of mounting:
	- Volume mounting (mount a volume)
	- Bind mounting (mount location on docker host)

CSI is a standart interface, which defines a set of rules for Storage drivers.
